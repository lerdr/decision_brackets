> DONE: ✔️ - WIP: 💬 - ERROR: ❌ - ON HOLD: 🔜 - BUG: 🐛

## Done

- add listeners on buttons ✔️
- create mock list in the background ✔️
- append & reset elements via btns ✔️
- "title" is text field, preselected on refresh ✔️
- pressing "enter" auto-clicks btn1 & clears title + autofocus ✔️
- pressing "shift + enter" logs "Extended functionalities to come" ✔️
- title -> description -> enter; tabindex & custom content ✔️
- create to array instead of list, just log ✔️
- draw background from array, not list ✔️
- draw whole background from array, not just append ✔️
- shift + enter should hide the card ✔️
- shift + enter should be enabled when there are 2+ elements, not before ✔️
- shift + enter should be meaningfully styled ✔️
- after the card is hidden, the software should automatically generate pairings ✔️
- fix: create & compare skips to compare, does not create! ✔️
- background elements should be drawn from array with objects ✔️
- new empty card should appear - call it comparison-card ✔️
- comparison-card should show two columns & two buttons ✔️
- the two columns should include title & description from selected comparison items ✔️
- buttons should tell which one to promote ✔️
- drawComparisonCard should set title, description, code of earliest non-judged ✔️
- selecting one option should cross the item out of the list and present the next ✔️

## Doing

- buttons should be triggered either by clicking or pressing the arrows 🔜

## Up Next

- when all comparisons are done, a new tier should be generated with survivors 🔜
- when only one item remains, that item should be clearly denoted as winner 🔜
- software should have a mode enum that limits keyboard interactivity 🔜
- I should be able to enter extra items after the comparison has begun 🔜
- new elements should be appendended in a new list, separate from comparisons 🔜
- after all new elements are entered, software should shuffle & add them to brackets 🔜
- card should animate when appearing & disappearing 🔜
- how do we edit elements? 🔜
- how do we empty the list, if the "shift+enter" won't be reset? 🔜

## Bugs

- fix: clicking on element leaves element :hover 🐛
- fix: empty title - tab to description - write - enter: no trigger 🐛
- fix: not responsive 🐛
