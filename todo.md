## Done

- add listeners on buttons ✔️
- create mock list in the background ✔️
- append & reset elements via btns ✔️
- "title" is text field, preselected on refresh ✔️
- pressing "enter" auto-clicks btn1 & clears title + autofocus ✔️
- pressing "shift + enter" logs "Extended functionalities to come" ✔️
- title -> description -> enter; tabindex & custom content ✔️
- create to array instead of list, just log ✔️
- draw background from array, not list ✔️
- draw whole background from array, not just append ✔️
- shift + enter should hide the card ✔️
- shift + enter should be enabled when there are 2+ elements, not before ✔️
- shift + enter should be meaningfully styled ✔️
- after the card is hidden, the software should automatically generate pairings ✔️
- fix: create & compare skips to compare, does not create! ✔️
- background elements should be drawn from array with objects ✔️
- new empty card should appear - call it comparison-card ✔️
- comparison-card should show two columns & two buttons ✔️
- the two columns should include title & description from selected comparison items ✔️
- buttons should tell which one to promote ✔️
- drawComparisonCard should set title, description, code of earliest non-judged ✔️
- selecting one option should cross the item out of the list and present the next ✔️
- buttons should be triggered either by clicking or pressing the arrows ✔️
- when all comparisons are done, a new tier should be generated with survivors ✔️
- when only one item remains, that item should be clearly denoted as winner ✔️
- software should have a mode enum that limits keyboard interactivity ✔️
- jquery bracket: init object and confirm basic functionality ✔️
- remove remnants of jquery bracket ✔️
- sanitize html injection ✔️
- descriptions: markdown to html? ✔️
