# Decision Brackets
## A simple aid in decision making

I read a blog post on FreeCodeCamp about a bunch of ideas for a Developer Portfolio.
One of them was the "sports bracket" project. I don't know if I'm thinking about the wrong thing, but I took it as the "tournament view" people sometimes use online to choose the best song from an artist.

My intent here is to create a simple tool that allows me to enter a collection of items and them randomize pairings, asking every time which item is the best in order to select the best one.
